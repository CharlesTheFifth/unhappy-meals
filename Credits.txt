Rhian and Theo at Jumping rivers for R tips and patience!
The Population Health Intelligence team at Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Parternship - Laura, Ian, Jess, Mary and Emily - for all their support
Jamie White and the Open Data Manchester team, for giving me the idea of IMD grids with their political control by IMD plots graph.
